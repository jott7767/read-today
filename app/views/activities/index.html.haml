              This summer reading program, presented by Read Today, Deseret News and KSL,
              in partnership with McDonalds and the Governorâ€™s Office, begins in June
              and runs through the summer. Kids, ages 2-14, are challenged to read or
              be read to, 20 minutes a day. Those who complete the summer reading challenge
              and submit their form receive fun prizes, including two tickets to a
              Salt Lake Bees Game. The fun continues on game night as readers are greeted
              at the gate with foam fingers and treats, making it a night to remember.
