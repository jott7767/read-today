      This summer reading program, presented by Read Today, Deseret News and KSL,
      in partnership with McDonalds and the Governorâ€™s Office, begins in June and
      runs through the summer. Kids, ages 2-14, are challenged to read or be read to,
      20 minutes a day. Those who complete the summer reading challenge and submit
      their form receive fun prizes, including two tickets to a Salt Lake Bees Game.
      The fun continues on game night as readers are greeted at the gate with foam
      fingers and treats, making it a night to remember.
