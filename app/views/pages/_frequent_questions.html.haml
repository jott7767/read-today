        AmeriCorps administers the program, uses the USOE's STAR program to train
        volunteers, collect data and ensure quality and consistency. KSL creates
        awareness, and provides incentives and celebrations with Chopper 5
        landings and literacy events. Partners who share our goals include The

        Volunteers are asked to provide 1-2 hours of service a week at an
        elementary school in your area. You will be tutoring a child 1:1 in a
        public area, where other tutors are serving, with supervision of a school
        reading coordinator. Prior to tutoring, volunteers are given a brief
        training and taught how to properly help children learn how to read.
